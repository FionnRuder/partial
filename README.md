# What is Partial?
Partial is a purpose-built work management platform for hardware development. It connects engineers’ work items (tasks, deliverables, issues) directly to the parts they own, giving teams a single source of truth. Managers gain instant insight into program health, dependencies, and bottlenecks, while teams and the customer benefit from increased transparency and fewer status meetings.
## Key Features
### For Engineers:
* Track work items for parts they own
* Manage tasks, deliverables, and issues
* Collaborate with team members
* Update progress and status against program milestones
### For Program Managers:
* Monitor program status
* Track team performance and workload
* Identify bottlenecks and blockers
* Manage milestones and trace their dependencies
## Hardware-Specific Features
* Hierarchical part management to reflect the actual hardware assembly (component → subsystem → system)
* Work items (tasks, deliverables, issues) link to specific parts, enabling part-centric views rather than people-centric stories/epics
* Hardware-specific deliverable types (drawing, BOM, CoC, ATP, etc.)
* Hardware-specific issue types (defect, failure, requirement waiver, etc.)
* Cradle to grave ownership of parts and work items through required user assignments
* Program analytics, team workload visualizations, and dynamic burndown charts
* Engineering discipline-based team organization (mechanical, electrical, structural, etc.) rather than feature/product-based
